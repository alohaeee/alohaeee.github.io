Hi! I'm Vladislav Dubrovsky, aka  __alohaeee__. 
Developer with ~2 years of experience. Familiar with: C++(14,17), Qt, C#(Unity-Scripting), JS/TS, WinAPI(a little). I publish my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/alohaeee).

I make games, sometimes write music, even less often I draw in pixel-art style.
